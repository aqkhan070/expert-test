# Welcome to your Lovable project

### 1. Added `industry` Field to Lead Interface

**Problem**  
The frontend was sending an `industry` field for lead submissions, but the backend `Lead` interface was missing this parameter. This caused TypeScript errors and ignored valuable user input.

**Solution**  
The `industry` property has been added as an optional field in the `Lead` interface:

```ts
interface Lead {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  industry: string;
  submitted_at: string;
}
```
### 2. ðŸ’¾ Implemented Function to Save Lead Data

**Problem**  
Lead data received from the frontend was not being persisted to the database, resulting in missing records.

**Solution**  
A new function was created to store incoming leads in the database, ensuring all data (including `industry`) is saved correctly.

```ts
import { db } from '../lib/db';

  const { data, error: dbError } = await supabase
          .from('leads')
          .insert([
            {
              name: formData.name,
              email: formData.email,
              industry: formData.industry,
              submitted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
            }
          ])
          .select();
```
